# Math for Machine Learning and Data Science

This repository was created to document and practice the knowledge acquired in the [Math for Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization/) course (DeepLearning.AI / Coursera).

The course covers essential topics such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics, with a focus on their practical application in real-world AI problems.

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### 1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux or macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the project

```bash
python -m src.nn
```

> Make sure you are in the project's root directory when running the command.
